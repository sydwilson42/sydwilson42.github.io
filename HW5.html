		<ol class="outline">
            <li>Make your high school team!<ul>
                <li>Practice!!!</li>
                <li>Work on important skills like ball-handling or shooting.</li>
                <li>Talk to the coach to see what they are looking for.</li>
                <li>Go to try-outs and show out!</li></ul>
            </li>
            <li>Join a good AAU summer team!<ul>
				<li>Important things to look for in a team<ol>
					<li>Your team needs to fit your style of play</li>
					<li>You need to have a coach you can trust and bond with (because you may need their help with recruiting)</li>
					<li>You want to join a team that is competitive and fits your skill level so you will benefit from this experience</li></ol>
				</li>
				<li>Use these tournaments and practices to improve your skills during the summer</li>
				<li>These are great exposure tools for college coaches!</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>Respond to all your recruiting contacts!<ul>
				<li>College coaches may email, text, call, or send a you a letter when trying to contact you.
					You must watch for these things so you can respond in a timely manner!</li>
				<li>Some may contact you through your high school or AAU coaches, so make sure you ask them as well.</li>
				<li>Lastly, make sure all responses are formal and timely, so they know you are interested and professional.</li></ul>
			</li>
			<li>Stay on top of applications, offers, etc!<ol>
				<li>Always apply ASAP after a coach asks you to do so. They will notice if you delay on things like this!</li>
				<li>Next you must send transcripts as soon as you can because they can take a few days to actually deliver<ul>
					<li>If you delay on this, it will delay your acceptance into school!</li></ul></li>
				<li>If you really like an offer, do not wait too long to accept it because it can be taken away.</li>
				<li>Lastly, if you know you are not going to choose a school who has offered you, just be honest. They may need to offer it to someone else.</li></ol>
